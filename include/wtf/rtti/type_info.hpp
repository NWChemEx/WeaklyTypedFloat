 * standardizes the state so that we know we get say the same name for the
 * same floating-point type across different compilers. It also provides
 * support for distinguishing between const and non-const types. Finally, it
 * provides some introspection properties, such as the precision of the type
 * and whether or not the type can be implicitly converted to another type.
